# GLAD Elementary Flow Resources

Hosted by UN Environmnet, the [Life Cycle Initiative](https://www.lifecycleinitiative.org/) is a public-private, multi-stakeholder partnership, launched in 2002, to enable the global use of credible life cycle knowledge and resources. 

In June 2020, the life cycle initiative launched the Global LCA Data Access (GLAD) netowrk initiative. As part of the [Global LCA Data Access (GLAD) network initiative](https://www.lifecycleinitiative.org/resources-2/global-lca-data-network-glad-2/) to make Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data accessible, this repository has been established to host elementary flow lists, mapping files and other resources. Users can access the GLAD [data portal](https://www.globallcadataaccess.org/) to view provider LCA data.

The GLAD Working Group on Nomenclature (WG1), a technical working group supporting the Life Cycle Initiative for GLAD maintains this repository.
