# Flow Lists    

Original source flows available in the [FlowList format](../flowlists/FlowList.md), that represent the sources at the beginning of the GLAD mapping project. These are before any additional edits were made to the harmonize. Minor edits to the original flow sources were made before using them as input data. Examples of such edits include, the addition or removal of flows, addition of CAS Numbers, ect. 

Originally, ecoinvent was using two versions to map to v3.5 & v3.6, however, as the work progressed sources updated their elementary flow list to include additional CAS numbers to improve automated mapping by the mapping tool. These additional CAS numbers were added using the PubChem database and resulted in ecoinvent releasing a newer version v3.7 of their mapping lists. The updated flowlists are present in the input file folder under [mapping](https://github.com/UNEP-Economy-Division/GLAD-ElementaryFlowResources/tree/master/mapping/Input).
